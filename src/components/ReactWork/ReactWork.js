            <p>
                React works in declarative code. To illustrate what we mean by declarative code,
                we want you to imagine the following code, represented as an application.
                We might be thinking of a screen similar to the one below,
                with a navigation bar, headers, filters, and lists.
                That's because each line of code declares what each element of the application is.
            </p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default ReactWork;
